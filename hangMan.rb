A set of blanks representing the letters in the words and spaces in the phrase. 
Another player will guess single letters that will autofill any blank space where that letter belongs. 
If the letter doesn't belong anywhere in the phrase, one out of six body parts will be added to the gallows. 
Each round the player can attempt to guess the phrase. 
If the player fails to get the phrase correct before the hangman is complete, the player fails.
